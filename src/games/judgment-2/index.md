description:   “We’re gonna chase the truth as far as we can.”
  
  Kamurocho isn’t exactly known for being the safest place in Japan, but even for this red-light district, a string of violent serial murderers has the entire city on edge. It’s up to private detective Takayuki Yagami and his partner Kaito to track down the truth using whatever tools they can. Get a look at just some of those tools (including a drone, lockpicks, and the muscles of a huge former Yakuza member, to name just a few) in our new Features Trailer!
