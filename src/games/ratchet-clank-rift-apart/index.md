This is my first ps5 game, that I play recently after I bought the new ps5 slim.

I enjoyed this game so much, it use all the new ps5 controller features and so
stratifying, it also fast based and good story line and nostalgic for me since I
played this franchise on ps2.

But also the game has downsides, the characters not well developed and not
remarkable like the old games.

and also the there is no variety in enemies and boss fights.


**my rating**: 8/10
