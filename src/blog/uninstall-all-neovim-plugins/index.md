# [Draft] Uninstall all neovim plugins


---
**draft**

- why we choose something like neovim/emacs and not a vscode,sublime
- the noovim plugins ecosystem is not mature enough
- do you need all that features on your code editor?
- only pick a plugin with a good documentation and well-written to avoid
  reconfigure your lua config.
