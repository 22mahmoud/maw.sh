        <p>Regarding doing terminal stuff inside neovim, try my plugin: <a href="https://github.com/nyngwang/NeoTerm.lua">nyngwang/NeoTerm.lua</a>, which is definitely better than creating tmux split, since you can attach a terminal for each window you want to run something instead of creating many many many tmux splits that split you life apart.</p>

        <p>And, since I know nowadays people are really really lazy to take a look at README.md here is the link to the <a href="https://github.com/nyngwang/NeoTerm.lua#demo">DEMO</a> of it.</p>
