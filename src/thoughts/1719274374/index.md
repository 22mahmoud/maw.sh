here is my todo list for my website, which is kinda complete, only missing two parts (taging, and
pagination).
```
- [x] autoamte index pages, by write custom script
- [x] custom templte for each page
- [x] custom #pandoc filter to optimize local/remote images
- [x] handle #webmentions
- [ ] tags/categories links
- [ ] pagination
- [ ] custom admin ui, to easly use my website from the mobile (in the future)
- [ ] redesign the #site (in the future)
```
